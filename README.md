# youtube-chapter-extractor
This project provides a Python script that automatically extracts chapter titles and their start times from YouTube videos that include chapters. It leverages the powerful yt-dlp tool to fetch chapter metadata, making it easy to generate a list of video sections and timestamps for summaries, notes, or sharing.
